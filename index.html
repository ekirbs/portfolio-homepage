            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Renaisssance man.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in Philosphy from Rutgers University.  I spent around 15 years as a fencing master and a teacher. 
                I thoroughly enjoyed my time educating the next generation, and I have developed a strong understanding of leadership, management, and many strategies 
                for teaching others complex concepts. But I felt like a square peg who found a way to fit himself seamlessly into a round hole.  I began searching, and 
                I've now found my place in the world of coding and web design.  I am excited to see where it goes from here.

            <p>
                This is my GitHub profile.  It is ever-growing, ever-changing, and ever-improved, just like the field of web design and coding!  Take a look around and see some 
                of the projects I've completed or that I'm working on.  Some of them are simple, some more complex, but I'm proud of it all, even if it's just because I can look 
                back and see how far I've come!

            <h3>Strong Teamwork Skills</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/working-together.png" alt="Efficiency is money." />
            <p>
                Teamwork is everything in this field.  The whole team of developers need to work together at all times to produce the best result, but it's also important to see management and clients 
                as teammates as well! We are all valuable cogs in the machine, and I love not only doing my job as best as possible, but helping those around me achieve greatness as well. If we all do 
                our parts then we will all succeed.

            <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/bright-mind.png" alt="A man with a bright idea." />
            <p>
                I have strong critical thinking skills and I'm good at conveying those ideas to others. In me, you will get original ideas and solutions, and a willingness to listen to others' 
                ideas and suggestions. The goal is always a great product, and it's the choices you make along the way that determine if you get there easily or not.

            <h3>Efficient Time Management</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/bottom-line.png" alt="Time is money." />
            <p>
                I am an effective worker.  I love pouring over lines of code. I love creating. And I love the feeling of a hard-fought success. I will work diligently to get the job done as accurately and 
                efficiently as possible. The bottom line is, my time is money...in your pocket!
