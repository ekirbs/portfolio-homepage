            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Renaisssance man.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in Philosphy from Rutgers University.  I spent around 15 years as a fencing master and a teacher. 
                I thoroughly enjoyed my time educating the next generation, and I have developed a strong understanding of leadership, management, and many strategies 
                for teaching others complex concepts. But I felt like a square peg who found a way to fit himself seamlessly into a round hole.  I began searching, and 
                I've now found my place in the world of coding and web design.  I am excited to see where it goes from here.

            <h2>GitHub</h2>
            <p>
                This is my GitHub profile.  It is ever-growing, ever-changing, and ever-improved, just like the field of web design and coding!  Take a look around and see some 
                of the projects I've completed or that I'm working on.  Some of them are simple, some more complex, but I'm proud of it all, even if it's just because I can look 
                back and see how far I've come!
